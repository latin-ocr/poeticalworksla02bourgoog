GOLIN’S COMPLAINT.

ΒΥ nicheus down.

Deeeninine beside a clear stream,
A shepherd iotsehen was laid3

And while a false nymph was his theme,
A willow supported his head.

The winde. that blew over the plain,
'i'o his sighs with a sigh did reply;

And the hrook. in return to his pain,
Rnn monrnsully murmuring hy.

Alasi silly swain that l wael
Thus sadly complnining‚ he cried;
When first 1 beheld that fair face,
'Twere better hy fer 1 had died z
She talk'd and l blest the dent tongum
When she sinil’d, 'twas a pleesure too great:
1 listen¹d, end cry'd‚ when she sung,
Wee nightingale ever so sweet!

How soolish wne Ito believe,
she could doat on so 10wa a clown i
Or, that her fond heart would not grieve,
To forsake the fine solk nithe town!

To think that a heauty so gay,
So kind and so constant would prove;

Or go clad lihe our maidens in grey,
Or live in n cottege on love 1
