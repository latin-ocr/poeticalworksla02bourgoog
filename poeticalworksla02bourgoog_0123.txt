Ye vlolels, tol),

And drinl the vernul dew}
Ι That'dmhlhe woods,
The munds, the floods‚
With dro'pn ol purple hue.¹ “

And all ye flowers,

Α Whose wilder stores

O'er nature's lace are seen ς
Whose various dyes
Promlscuous rlse,

And paint th· enamell’d green.

Come, herbs‚ all ye
That templ the bee
From leaf toleaf lo roam
Whose balmy velus
Reward her paim,
And send her loaded home.

Of ev’ry kind,

Twisl arm' in arm,

Weave charm wilh ellum,
To Phyllis haste away.
