province, he is always strictly classicel: alicense
may here and there he discovered, in which no
poet of the Augustan age would have indulged.
Yet all that the severity of minute criticism
may urge against his productioris we may safely
challenge the first of the Roman elegiasts to
produce any thing equal to his “Thyrsis and
Chloe‚” or his “Lucia et Corydon ;” while in
chasteness of humour, and elegance of expression,
his “lter per Tamisin,'' and most of the poems
translated by Cowper‚ can never be surpassed.
On the whole, 110 one will deny that he stands at
the head of those of our countrymen who have -
cultivated the Latin muse: nor need we sear foi·
him a comparison with Scotland's celebrated
Buehanan. But a far higher glory than that of
genius must be awarded to him: to a writer so

freely giving the rein to his humour, itis no
small praise to be able to assert, that he lest

N ο line when dying he could wish to blot.

We have only to add, that in addition to his
poetioal effusione, the present volume contains
two lettels of Vincent Boume3 the one to a
young lady, and the other-which we have already
mentioned-to his wife; aud we think we may
with safety offer to the public the present edition
as the most complete and accessible form of our
author's productione.
