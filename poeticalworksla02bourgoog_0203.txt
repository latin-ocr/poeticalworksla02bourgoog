TRANSLATED BT Wllalrldhl ΟΟἪΡΕΚ, ESQ·

There is e book, which we may cell
(lle excellence is such)

Alone a librery‚ though smalh
The ledies thumh it much.

Words none, things numerous it contains:
And things with words compared,

Who needs he told, thet hes hie hrains,
Which merit most regards?

Ofttimes its leaves ol scerlet hue
A golden edging boest;

And open'd, ir diepleys to view
Twelve peges et the most.

Nor neme, nor title, stemp'd behind,
Adorns its outer pert;

But all within 'lie richly lined‚
A megezine of art.
