Then to her new love let her go,
And deek her in golden array;
Be finest at ev'ry fine show.
And frolick it all the long day:
While Corin, forgotten and gone,
No more shali be talh’d of, or seen,
Unless when beneath the pale moon
His ghost shall glide over the green.

When all was wrapt in dark midnight,
And all were fast aaleep,

In glided Margaret’s grimly ghost‚
And stood at William’s feet.

Her face was like the April mom,
clad in a wintry cloud ;

And clay-cold was her lily-hand,
That held the aable shroudr

So shall the fairest face appear,
When youth and years are flown ς

Such is the robe that kings must wear,
When death has rest their crown.
