TWEED-SIDE.

ei noum calvione.

Wuew beaulies does Flore diselosel ι
How sweet ereher smiles upon Tweed l
Yet Mery's, still sweeter than those,

Both nature and ieney exeeed.

Nor daisy, ner sweet-hlushing rose,
Nor all lhe gay ilow'rs oi the field.

Nor Tweed‚ gliding genlly through those,
Such beeuty and pleeeure does yield.

The warblers ere heard in the grove,

The limet, the lark, end the thrush ;
Δ The blackbird‚ ¹end sweet-eooing dove,

With music enchant ev'ry bush.

Come, lei us go forth to the moad,
Let us see how the primroses spring;

We'll lodge in some village on Tweed‚ j
And love, where the iealhered solil sing.
