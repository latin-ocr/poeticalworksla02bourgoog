SONG of THE THREE CHILDREN.

an’nn God's fiat did from nothing mise,

Stupehdous prbduct of the first six dayS,

O bless your Maker, your Creator praise.
In this let jarring elements agree,

Or make from discord sweetest harmony.

Ye sons of light made by his power divifie3
By his reflected beams it is you shine;
Your hallelujahs in the chorus jein,
That, sar as creatures can, your praise may prove

Great as his power, and endless as his love.
