Ye clouds with sulphur charg'd, his praise resound,
Louder than thunder in your cuverns bound; Ι
Lightnings‚ thar quickly die, and dying wound, '
Ere yet your momentary flash is done,
Praise him, whose lustre can be never gone.

Praise him, 0 earth, whilst thou thyself shall lasl;

'th solid orb in liquid aether placed,

Tho* hung on nothing, is lor ever fast: ·
Praise him whose being is suslcin'd by none;
Himsell is contre os himself alone.

Ye mounts and hills, crown’d with apompous load
Of groves, where idols placed their old abode,
Resound the praises ol a real God,
Whoshow¹d his goodness, who proolcirn'd his will,
On Horeb’s mountain, and on Sina’s hill.

Praise him, ye greens, by fruitsul nature nnn,

And rising crops that plenteous vales odorn

Where zephyrs rustle thro‘ the wavy corn;
Who clothes in greater stete ecch springing green
Thon that which drew frorn sar the southern queen.

Ye wells und slreems, your source ol moisture know,
Who made, when urged of old his pow¹r to show,
Foru froin th’ obedient rocl. lhe waters flow.

Nor is the sountein oi his praises dry,

But unexhausted stores for ever will supply.
