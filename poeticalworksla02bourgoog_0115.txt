The chain l'll in return unller
And lreely thou egeln shall lly,”
Thus she the eoplire did deliver;

⁵ ‘l'he captive thus gave up his quivsr.

The god diserm’d‚ e'er since that day,
Posses his lile in harmless play; ’
Flies round, or sits upon her bremt,

A little, flutl’ring, idle guest.

E’er sinos thet day, the beauteous maid ⁵
Governs the world in Cupld’s need,
Directs his orrows as she wills;
Gives grief or pleneme, speres or kills.

GHLOE HUNTING.

ΒΥ emon.

Brnrnn her neck her comely tresses ried,

Her iv'ry quiver graceful by her side,

A hunting Chloe went: she lost her wey,

And through the noods uncertain ohono’d to strsy.
Apollo passing by ¹beheld the maid 3

And, Sister deor, bright Cynthia, turn, he ssid;
The hunted hind lies close in ⁴yonder brnke.

Loud Cupid laugh'd, to see the god’s mistelre:
And loughing nied, Lenrn better, great divine,
‘l'o know thy lindred, end to honour mine.
