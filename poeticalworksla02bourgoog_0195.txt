STRADA'S NIGHTINGALE.

TRANSLATED ni wrnttnrt coms, 18οι

Tne shepherd toueh'd his reed3 sweet Philome}
Essay'd, and oft essay'd to catch the strein,
And trensuring, an on her ear they fell,
The numbers, eoho'd note sor note again.

The p'eevish youth, who ne'er had found before*
A rival of his skill, indignant heard,

And soon (ior various was his tuneful stote)
In loftier tones defied the simple bird.

She dared the tash, and, rising as he rose,
With all the force that passion gives, inspired‚
Return'd the sounds awhile, but in the close
Exhausted fell, and'nt his feet expired.

Thus strength and skih prevail’d. 0 fatal striiei
By thee, poor songstress‚ playhrlly begun;
And, Ο sad victory! which eost stylite,
And he may wish that he had never woh!
