With her bright innocense shall go,
Purer than the falling snow:

Quiet, that far stom quarrels llies;
Mirth and pleneme, love and joys:
Firm saith, that plighted promise keeps,

Silence watehing o’er her lips:
Prudence, that ponders all events,
Wealth-increasing diligente:
Religion, mindful what is owed
'l'o herself and to her God.
Patient to bear, to pardon free,
Loveliest grace, humanityl
li erring nature chance to fail,
Feeble‚ inadvertent, frail:
Who hates lowawhisper'd spite conceal'dt
Soanda] yet to lew reveal'd;
Since envy makes. with rumour'd' lies
Friends and brethten enemles,
Good-breeding shall her handmaid be,
Join’d with chaste-look'd modesty;
While open beart, and hand, and face,
Hospitality displays.
If e'er Melissa grace your home,
These attendants with her come.
Whate’er can good or ill befall,
Faithful pertner she of all.
Whose wisdnm, teaching well to bear,
Soothes the bitterness of care;
Whose joy, if prosp'rous fate you meet,
Adds new sweetness to the sweet.
