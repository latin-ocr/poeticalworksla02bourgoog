Boots bought, or boote borrow’d awhip cr a switch,

Paid part into hand :-you must weit ior the rest.

Thus equipt‚ Academicus climbs up his horse,

And out they both sully, for better or worse;

His heart void of fect, and es light ase ieather,

And in violent haste ιο go not knowing whither.

Through the ficlds end the towns (ceci) hc ecem-

Down tumbies hie horse, men and cil in the cnud.

Young gentlemen, hear 1..1 em older then you,
The advice thet Ι give I have proved to be true:

Wherever your journey may be, never doubt ic.
The faetet you ride, you’re the longer about it.
