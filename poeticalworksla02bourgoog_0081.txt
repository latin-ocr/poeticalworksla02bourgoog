Nor tory‚„ or whig, observator or trimmer Ι

Moy Ι be, nor against the law’s torrent a sulmmor.

May Ι mind what Ι speuli, what l write and hear read,

And with mutters ol stote never trouble my houd.
May Ι govern, διο.

Lot the gods, who dispose ol every king's eroum,

Whomsoever thoy pleone, set up und pull domu

Ill puy the whole ohilling impos’d on my huod,

Tho' l go without clareto that night to my hed.
May Ι gottern, &o

l’ll blood without grumhling, though thot tuxx should
appear
As oft as new mouns, or weehs in u year.

For why should Ι let a seditious word lull,
Since my lando! in Utopiu² puy nothing ot all?
May 1 gottern, διο.

Tho’ 1 cure not for tichos, may Ι not he oo poor,
'l'hot the rich without shame cannot enter my door;
May they court my converso* moy they talio much
delight
My old stories to henr in o winter’s long night.
May Igoverm διο.

uThone odious nomes of distinction kindled great
animosity aud strangeness, and even hatred, betwixt re·
latinns ond friends.
