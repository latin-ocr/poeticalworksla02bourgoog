THE SlLK-WORM.

humum ΒΥ W. cumn, ΒΕΘ.

Tm: beams of April, ere it goes,

A worm, scarce visible‚ disclose;

All winter long content to dwell

The tenant oi his native shelli

The same prolific season gives

The sustenance by which he liveS,

The mulberry-leaf, a simple stote,

That serves him-till he needs no more!
For, his dimensions once complete,
Theneesorthnone ever sees him θεῖς
Though, till his growing time be past,
Scarce ever is he seen vto fast.

Thei hour arrived, his work begins;

He spins and weaves, and weaves and spins;
Till circle upon circle wound

Careless around him and around,
Conceels him with a veil‚ though slight,
impervious to the keenest sight.

Thus sels-enclosed, as in a eesk,

At length he finishes his tasi:
