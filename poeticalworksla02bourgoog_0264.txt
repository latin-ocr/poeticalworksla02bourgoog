ΤΗΕ INNOCENT THIEF.

mmmm> ΒΥ mmm coma, ΕΒΗ.

Nor afiower ean be found in the fields,
Or the spot that we till for our pleasure‚

From the largest to least, but it yields
The bee, never-wearied, a treasure.

Scaree any she quite unexplored,
With a diligence truly exact3

Yet, steal what she may for her hoard,
Leaves evidence none of the fact.

Her lucrative task she pursueS,
And pilfers with so much address,
That none of their odour the'y lose,
Nor cham] by their beauty the less.

Not thus inoffensively preys
The cankermorm, indwelling foe!
His voracity not thus allays

'l'he sparrow, the finch, or the crOW.
