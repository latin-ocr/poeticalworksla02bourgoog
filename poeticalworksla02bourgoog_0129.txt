MELISSA.

mmmm ΒΥ ΜΒ. S. wesm.

Ir, friend, awife you mean to wod
Worthy of your boord and bed,

Thot she be virtuouS, be your care,
Not too rich, and not too fair:
One who nor labours to display

New complexions every day,
Nor, studying artificia} grace,
Out of boxes oulls a face. ’
Nor livelong hours sor drossing sparos,
Placing, to displnoe, her haim,
And straight replace3 on idle pin
Ten times shifting out and in.
Nor daily varies, voinly nice,
Thrice her silks, and colours thrice:
Fond o'er and o'er her suits to range,
Changing still, and still to change.
Nor gods to pay, with busy air,
Trifling visits here and there;
Long rapping at each do'or aloud,
Nuisance to a neighbourhood.
If e’er a play she deign to see,

(Very rarely shall it. be,)
