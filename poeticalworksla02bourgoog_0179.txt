‘Pmoun pments, athis birth.
Mourn their habe with many a tear,
But, with undissembled mirth‚
Place hIm brenthless on his bier.

Greeoe and Rome, with soom,
‘⁴ 0 the savages 1¹¹ exclaim,

¹· whether they rejoice or mourn,
⁶· Well entitled to the name 1⁶⁸

But the cause os this concern,

And this pleasure, would they traco,
Even they might somewhat leam

From the mages of Thrace.
