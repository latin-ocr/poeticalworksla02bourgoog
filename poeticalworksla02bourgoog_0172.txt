THE FANATIC,

Wnsn first to spealr uprises Simon Pure,

Silent he stands, with conntenance demum

He coughs‚ he spits, with many a bawlr and hem,
To clear a way sor words and utter them:

His gloves beside him on the pulpit lie,

ἢ llis two broad hands to heav’n are lilted high;

With eyelids shut he gronna, ior, closely pent.
The murm'ring spirit struggles lor a vent;
At length a voice breaks out beneath his bot,
Another, and another aiter that ι
But fair and solt, with frequent pauses mixt.
And many a sigh‚ end many a groan betwixtt
Till by degrees be fons, with zealot ire.
'l’he dormant eoals ol Puritanio lire.
Anon, he startS, he bounds, on tiptoe stands,
Roars with his voice, and hammers with his hands3
The strength oi lungs he tries, he pants, he blows,
And down his oheelrs the sweat profusely ilows:
To ev‘ry soul he threatens instant doom,
And asanatic tempest shalres the room.

So rising Boreas first, with lenient breeze,
Fons the light leaves, end murmurs thro' the trees}
His cheelrs inflated soon a tempest blow.
Shnlre their full tops above, their trunlrs below:
