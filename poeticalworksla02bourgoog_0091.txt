“O Susan, Susan, lovely deur!
My vows shall ever true remsin;
Let me kiss off that falling teet:
We only part to meet again.
Chenge as ye list, ye winds; my henrt shall be
The faithful compass, that still points to thee.

“ Relieve not what the lsndmen say,

Who tempt with doubts thy constant rnind;
They’ll tell thee, sailors, when away,

ln every port a mistress find:
Yes‚ yeS‚ believe them when they tell thee sn,
For thou art present, wheresoe'er l go.

‘⁴ ll to fair lndia's coast we sall,
Thy eyes are seen in dismonds bright:
Thy breatb is Afric's spicy gele;
Thy skin is ivory so whitez
Thus every beauteous object that l view,
Wakes in my soul some oharms of lovely Sue.

“ Though battle call me frorn thy unns,
Let not my pretty Susen mourn;
Though cannons roan, yet safe srorn hnrms
Willinrn shall to his desr return ;
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,
Lest precious tears should drop from Sussn’s eye.”
