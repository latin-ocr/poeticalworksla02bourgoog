Praise him, ye heavens, longas your lrarne shall last,

Who like a curtain spread the azure waste.

And iu your happy realrns his throne has placed ι
His utmost splendour still io you appears 3

O tune in praise the music ol your spheres

Waters that by the Almighty placed above,

Fixed as your firmament for ever prove:

Praise hirn whose spirit did on the waters morer

Who made you free lrorn winde and storms below

Whose praise can npver ebb, nor ever flow.

Thrones‚ potentates, dominiona powers on high.
Aclrnowledge your superior in the sky ;
And bless the universal Majesty,

Whose word 's omnipoteni, whose will is late,

The only powerful and the only great.

l

Praise him, Ο sun; he on the etherial throne

without eclipses has for ever shone‚
