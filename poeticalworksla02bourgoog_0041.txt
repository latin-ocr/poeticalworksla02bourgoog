Thou sawst the wide-extended deep
In all its horrore rise !

And fear in ev’ry heart,
When waves on wavee and gulphs in gulphs‚

Thy mercy set me free ;
While in the confidenee of prey'r,

For tho‘ in dreadful whirls we hung,
High on the broken wave,
1 knew thou wert not slew to hear,

Nor impetent to save.

The sturm was laid, the winds retir’d.
Ohedient to thy wilh

Thesea, that roar’d at thy command,
At thy command was still.

ln midst of daugma, fears, and deutha,
Thy goodness l'll adore;

And preise thee for thy mercies pest,
And humbly hope for more.
