SWEET WILLIAM'S FAREWELL ΤΟ

BLACKAEYED SUSAN.

ΒΥ GAY.

Ain in the Downs the fleet was moor'd‚
The streamers waving in the wind,

When blech-eyed Susan came on heard,-
“ 0h1 where shall 1 my true lore find?

Tell rne, ye jovial seiiore, teil rne true,
Does my sweet Wiiliam snil ernong the cren :³¹⁵

william, who high upon ihe γετό,
Roek’d with thebi110wsto and fro,
Soon ee her well-known voice he heard,
He sigh’d, and cast his eyes below.
The cord slides swistly through his glowing hands,
And (quick ns lightning) on the decii he stands.

So the sweet lark, high pois’d in eir,
Shuts close his pinions io his breast,
1r chance his mate's shrili note he hear,
And drops nt once into her nest.
The noblest captain in the British fleet,
Might envy Wiiliam’s i‘rps those kisses sweet.
