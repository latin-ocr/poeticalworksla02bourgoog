How does my love pass the long day?
Does Mary not tend e few sheep?

Do they never carelessly stray,
While happily she lies esleep?

Tweed's murmurs should lull her to rest.›
Kind nature indulging my bliss;

'1¹0 relieve the sort peins os my bremt,
I'd steal en ambrosial kiss.

'Tie she does the virgins excel,
No beauty with her can eompar03
Love’s greces ah round her do dwelh
She's fairest‚ where thousande ere faire
Say. charmer, where do thy ssocks strey?

0111 tell me, st neon where they seed?
Shall Ι seeh them on eweet-winding Tay,
Or the pleasanter banks of the Tweed?

LUCY AND COLIN.

Or Leinster‚ farned for maidens fair.
Bright Lucy was the grecee

Nor e’er did Liffy's limpid stream
Reflect so seir e fece,

Till luekless love, and pining care,
Impair’d her rosy hue,

Her corel lips. and damesk cheeks
And eyes of glossy blue.
