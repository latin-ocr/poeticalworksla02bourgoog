Here lies
Jonrr Arenae, Esq; doctor oi physic,
One of his Majesty's Justices oi the Peece
For the County oi Westmoreland; who
Departed thia lite the 4th of December, unccxxxv.
He was e worthy man, a skilful physician,
An impartial magistrate, and an amiable friend:
His mind nas genereus, his temper sneet,
His understanding extensive,
In nature he was compassionate,
In virtue severe.
He adorned the reasonable being
With the dignity oi morality;
The true christian,
With the sanctity of religion.
He nes a delight to hie acquaintance,
An honour to his profession,

And an happiness to his country.
Dear and desirable ie the mernory of Dr. Archer,
s Cruel and lamentable is the loss oi him:
Every eye overflows with teate,
Every breast is filled with sorrow,
And every house is become
The house oi mourning.
