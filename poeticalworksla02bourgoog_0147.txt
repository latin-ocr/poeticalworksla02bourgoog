Annnornns, from h're injured lord, in dread

Of instent death, to Lybin‘s desert fied,

Tired with his toilsorne night, end parch'd with heet,
He epied at length e cavern's eool retreet;

But ecerce hed given to rest hie wenry freme,
When, hugeet of his kind, a lion cerne:

He roer’d approaehing: but the ravage din

To pleintive murmure changed-arrived within,
And with expressive looks, hie liner paw
Presenting, eid implored from whom he serr.
The fugitive, through terror et a stand,

Dnred not enhile efford his trembling hend;
Bur beldet grown, nt length inherent found

Α pointed thorn, and drew ir from the wound.
The eure wne wrought r-he wiped thesenious blood,
And finn end free from pnin the lion stood.
Agnin heseeks ne wnrs. {nr ray by day
Regulos his inmate with the parted prey.

Nor he disdains the dole, though unprepered,
Spreed on the ground, and with a lion shared.
But thus to live-still lost-sequester'd still-
Scerce seem’d his lord’n revenge a henvier ill.
