Wnah rising hom the bed ο1 death,
O'erwhelm’d with guilt and sear,

1 see my Maker face tolete,

11 yet, while pardon may be found,
And mercy ¹may be sought,
My heart with htward horror shrinks.
And trembles at the thought.

When thou, O Lord, shalt stand disclos’d
ln majesty severe,
And sitin judgmenton my seul,
Oh ! how shall lappearl

But thou hast told the troubled soul,
Who doea her sins lament,
The timely tribute ο1 her tears
Shall endless woe prevent.
