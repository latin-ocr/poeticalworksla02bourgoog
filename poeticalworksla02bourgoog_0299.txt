EPILOGUE ΤΟ ANDRIA,

ΒΥ suro.

Roou here-for 1 am corneto vent my joy;

Son Pamphilus has got a chopping boy.

Much preparation there hes been, I see.

Against this time, though nil unknown to me.

Here stood a tankard worthy of its wine,

There did a cradle in rich domask shine,

Cape, clodis, end swaddling clothes hung deninng on 1
the line ε

For sons get children at their fathers’ ooet, 1
ΑΗ things are trim, but we must pay the ronst.

But yet here may remain e dismal scene,
All are perplext 'twixt joy and seer within:
Mysis, poor tim'rous souli forgets ιο prettle;
And, what's more strange, the toping nurse her boteler
Crito, poor rnan! longs to be jogging honre, Ἴ

Bur dares not stir before he knows his doom.
To keep us all in temper then, 1 pray‚

Smiie on the entertainment of this plny;
Dismiss us kindly ιο our suger’d saoh,

And make it not indeed a groaning cake:

So shall we wish each sex may ever find,
Their hearers candid, ond specntors kind,
