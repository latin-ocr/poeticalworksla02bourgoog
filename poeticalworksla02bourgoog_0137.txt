Tho’ shorter lines her flx'd dominions hind,
Her floating empire stretehes unconfined.
From 'rhetis' stores, and not her neighbours’ spoih, .

’ She draws her treasure, fruit of honest toils.

Rome sack'd. end plunder’d; Britain clothes and
seeds; ’
Aequires their nobes, hut supplies their needs.

Sweet seat oi freedom 1 be thy heppier doom,
To ’serpe the sete, es well es guilt of Rome:
Where riot, offspring os unwieldy store,

Enerv'd those arms, that sneteh’d the spoil before„
With oostly ostes she stein'd her srugsl hoerd,

· Then with ill-gotten gold she bought e lord.
corruption, discord, luxury combined, .

Down sunk the iar-iamed mistress of mankind.

Heer, righteous princel Ο henr us loud invoke
Thy worth unhlemish⁰d‚ to evert this stroke:
Yourseli so free from ev’ry lswless view,

You scarce admit the homage thet is due.

Let other monarche, with invasive hands,

Lessen their people, and extend their lends;

ΒΥ gasping nations heted and obey'd,

Lords of the deserte, that their sword hes mede;
¹²⁰¹ thee kind heav’n a nohler tnslr design'd,

Το fix thy empne on thy people's mind;
