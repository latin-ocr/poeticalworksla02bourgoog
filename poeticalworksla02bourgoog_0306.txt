EPILOGUE TO HARRY THE FOURTH.

arom ΒΥ masnata.

Taar plaguy Percy almost broke my back;
Nay and my wind too 3-hoy‚ a cup of sack.
There’s not a man cares less than lfor death,
But plaguy fighting puts one out of hreath:
Yet ifbright honour calls me to a fray,

I shall he very bold-to-run away.

Well; when the king makes plump sir John a lord,
Then I'm resolv'd-never to keep my word.

First l’ll begin with hostess Quiokly: much

She 'gins to talk of ladyship and coaoh;

A body cannot owe 'm a little money,

But strait the jadas must think of matrimony.

But yet a trial< worth two of that I’ll play her ;
Poor looll nor love nor money will 1 pay her.

If ln the street a civil dun should eome;

Pray come to-morrow, and-l'll hesrom home.

If in the hall a number should appear,

My lord ’s asleep‚ sir, in his elbon chain.

When tradesmen gron impatientfor their due,
‘Tis so long standing-never talk of 't-'pshewl
I’ve good preferment in my eye lor you.

For sampstress Doll, How doth Miss Prae? poor sooll
l’ll pay sort, send her to the dancing school.
