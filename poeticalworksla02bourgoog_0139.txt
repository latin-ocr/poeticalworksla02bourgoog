lligh on thy British throne, ιο mark from far.

And calm the billows ol the rising wan

To smoolh lhe lrowns on fair Europa's face,

And force reluctant nations ιο embrace.

As late the jarring winds, with mingled roar,
Struggletl ιο wreok, yet walted you ιο shore:

So shall the stom, that threals your peaceful land,
Roll harmless o'er, or burst, where you command.

ODE ΟΝ THE DEATH OF A LADY,

wno ιινιο οιε nummu γειιο, ΑΜ) man ou una
mmm, 1728.

'rausum ΒΥ W. cowm, ESQ.

Ancum dame, how wide and vast
To a tace like ours appearS,
Rounded to an orb al last,
All thy multitude of years!

We, the herd ol human kind,
Frailer and of seebler powers ;

We. to narrow bounds confined,
Soon exhaust the sum os ours.
