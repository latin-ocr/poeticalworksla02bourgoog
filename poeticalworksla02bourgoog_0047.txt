ΑΝ ODE.

u.

Soon os the evening shodes proveri,

The moon takes up the wond’rous tale,

And nightly‚ to the lietening earth,

Repente the story oi her birth:

Whilst eil the stare thot round her burn,

And oli the planete in their turn,

Conflrm the tidings‚ os they roll,

And spread the truth irom pole to pole.
Διιι.

What though, in solemn silence, all

Move round this dork terrestria} balli ,

What though nor real voice nor sound

Amidoi their radiant orbs be found?

ln reason’s eor they oll rejoice,

And utter forth a glorious voice,
, For ever ringing as they shirre,
“ The hand that made us is divine.”
