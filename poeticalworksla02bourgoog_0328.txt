Α LETTER

PRO!

THE AUTHOR ΤΟ A YOUNG LADY.

Ι ΑΜ just corne from indulging a very pleasing
melancholy in a country churchyerd, end peying a Ι
respectlul visit to the dead, of which l am one day to
increase the number. As the solemnity end awiul-
ness ol the place does instently effect the beholder,
the solitude and silence of it does equally dispose him
to attention and meditation: so that we nowhere
lind amore useful and improving retirement. Every
monument has its instruction, and every hillock has
its lesson of mortality.

Ι heve, by this means, in e short space of time read
the history ol the whole villege3 and could tell the
names of its principel semilies, for the last thirty or
lorty years= 1 might perhaps go a little higher; but
here, by the injury of time and weether, the register
begins to be interrupted‚ end the letters are generally
so delaced‚ thetis an inscription can be made out, it
is not without much difficulty and conjecture.
