From the vein bride. (ahl bride no morel)

The varying orimooo θοᾶς

When. stretoh'd before her rival’s norro,
She saw her husband deod.

He to his Luoy's new-mode grove,
Conyey'd by trembling ewrino,

Ono mouldwith hor, bonoeth one eod,
For ever now remam*

Ost ot this grove, the constent hind
And plighted maid are eoem

wnn garlanda gay, and true-love knots,
They deok the sacred green.

But, swain soresworn, whoe'er thou art,
This hallow’d spot sorbonn

Remember Colin’o drendful sate,
And fear to meet him there.

nnvlcss TO CHLOE.

Dm Chloe, while thus beyond mensure,
You trent me with doubts and disdain,

You rob rdl your youth of in pressure,
And hoard up an old age os pain.

Your maxim, thot love is still founded
On ohnrms that will quiokly deoay,

You’ll find to be very ill grounded‚
When once you its dictatos obey.
