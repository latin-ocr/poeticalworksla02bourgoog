'ON THE AscENsloN.

ΥΕ numerous hosts oi angels bright‚
Your winged multitudes prepare,
In all your grandem to attend
The king oi glory thro' the air.

0 make your sweetest harmony,

As he triumphant takes his ssight;
Towering on higii above the sun,

Thro' realms immense oi spacious light.

In choicest hyms, melodious thron‘g‚
Salute the conqueror, your king3
ln joysul lays and loudest strains,
Ye blest, your God retusning sing.¹

And now, in majesty divine,

He sits enrob'd by 's Faiher's side3
But still vouchsaies to intercede

For siniul man, ior whom he died.

Then, man, thy deur Redeemer bless,
With thankiul beart, as they above ·,
With them begin a song oi praise,
A song as endless as his love.
