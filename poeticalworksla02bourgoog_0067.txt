How could you promise love to me,
And not that promise keep?

Why did you swenr mine eyes were might,
Yet leave those eyes to weep?

How could you say, my lip was sweet,
And made the scariot pale?

And why did I, young witless maid,
Beiiere the flatt’ring tale?

That face, alas! no more is fain

Thai lip no longer red;
Daris are mine eyes, now closed in death,
’ And ev’ry charm isfled.

The hungry worm my sister is;
This winding-sheet 1 wear3

And coid and weary lasts our night,
Tin that last morn appear.

But harh! the eock has warn'd me hence:
Α long and last adieu!

Come see, false mani how low she lieS,
'I'hat died for love oi you.

Now birds did sing, and morning smile,
And show her glitiering head:

Pale William shook in every limb,
Then raving lest his bed.
