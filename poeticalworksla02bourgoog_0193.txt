THE CAUSE WON.

TRANSLATSD B! W. coms, HQ·

Two netghbours furiously dispute‚

A fleld the subject of the suit:

Trivici the spot, yet such the rege

With which the combetcnts engrrge¹

'Twere hard to tell who covets most

The price-st whctsoever eost.

The plesdings swellz words still suffice:

No single word but hes its prices

No term but yields some scir pretence

For novel and increosed expense.
Defendant thus becomes c neme,

Which he that bore it mey disclcim,

Since both, in one description blended,

Ars plcintiffs-when the suit is ended.

PLUS somn OPORTET, QUAM LOQUI.

Qun gravitas oculis! et que constantis fronti!
Sobrius ut toto pectore bubo sopiti

Ales Pythagora dignus, dignusque Minervci
Sermonis parcus, consiliique teneri

Oh habitet tecum, bubo, et sit pectore in isto,
Quicquid hebes: quoties effluet, omen erit.
