PREFACE.

ln is difficult to read and admire any work with·
out feeling considerable interest in the author
personally. From admiring the productior of
the mind, we insensibly glide into feelings of re·
gard for the person, and all that concerns the
writer who has afforded us so much gratification;
and it is some consolation, when he himself has
quitted the stage, to contemplate, with feelings of
respect, and almost of adoration, the birth-place
of our unknown friend. With regard, however,
to the author whose works are contained in this
volume, we have no such advantage. His works
are nearly the only monument of his existence.
It is remarkable that even his birth-place is not
known, and from the time already elapsed since
his death, we may now fairly suppose that it will
never be ascertained.

It appears that he was born in 1695, and was
educated at Westminster‚ being admitted on the
foundation in 1710. He proceeded from thence
to Trinity Collega, Cambridge, of which he after·
wards became Fellow. Helinally accepted the situ·
ation of usher in the Westminster school, in which

office he died on the ind of December, 1747.
