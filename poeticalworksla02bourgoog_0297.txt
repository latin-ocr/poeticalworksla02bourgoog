PROLOGUE TO IGNORAMUS,

BT Annonlns.

Oncr in an age let ignoramus corne

To make arisit near his proper horne;

Long is it since at Cambridge hc appear’d,
And from that time (1 speak with due regard)
He has not oft at Westminster been heard.

Il any such there be among the gown,

He’s some recorder os a sections town,

Or petty manager against the crown,

An ignoramus amongst all the swam,

Can not be seen here ev'ry day in term;
Nonc to the har or to the bench pretends
But he that laws with eloquence defends.
Against the gown no evil we intend,

On thern onr glebe and future tithes depend;
All we propose is to give some delight,

Α scholar-like diversion for a night.

For at the ancient seat os learning, where
This play first enter’d on a theatra

The gravent students deign’d to have a share.
And twice, il Cambridge poets rightly sing,
Did ignoramus entertain a king.

The character his pleasant humour hit;

The king with gracious mirth had like to split-
There was another rhyme, bnt not so fit.

Our hope is then, though black should be our doom.
Il less diverted‚ you'll go sweeter horne.
