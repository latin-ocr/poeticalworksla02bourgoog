EPlLOGUE TO THE ADELPHL

⁸1³0an uu cenenum,

ENGLISHED.

Poon nurse is sent to bid you ul good h’ye,
Α plain, but neat and tight old woman 1,
(Except what should excepted be, you know.)
A very meer old trot from top to too.
But come, dear Faustus, try enchantments here,
And make e’en me a blooming maid appear ς
To look with beauty‚ und to move with ease,
And nioely taught a thousand ways to pleuse.
[ste waoeo o mand.
Sponte, do long lappets wauton wave in air,
. Does the struit cawl prens down my nubum hair?
Are patches rang’d of large and smaller siue?
Bare to my snowy chest‚ say, does my bosom riso?
My spreading hoop mise stiff its ampler sphere,
A sevenfold arch, an amphitheatro? ¹
Ah! conjuret FaustuS, vain thy wand and skiu.
Nor are old women witohes when they will.
[Sta breaks the wand.
Old as 1 was, 1 am3 whate'er they say,
Grey were my looks before, and stillare grey.
No strutting hoop my dangling clothes bears out.
. Red was, and red remeius. my pettiooat.
