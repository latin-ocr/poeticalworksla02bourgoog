Hau ya, whose sacred multitudes
In numbers cannot be expreet;

The joyful regions of the blest;

' To you our humble verse we bring;

Ye bloet attendants of your Lord‚
While he vouchsat'd ou earth to preoeh,
By him as Messengera the word
Throughout the world sent forth to teaoh3
'Tuas you the happy tidinga brought,

Youraelves performing what you taught.

Ye propheta, who with ardent zeal
Anu knowledge heavenly possent,
To future ages did reveal
The ae‘crets of Jehovah'a breeat;
'Tuas you, enlighten’d from above,
¹Foreaaw and told that God wasylove

You were the ohuroh's best defence,
Ye martyre now enthron'd on high,
Bravely secure in innocence,
And boldly resolute to die;
During (so firmly ya withstood)
In spite of melico to be good.
