These traces for ever will lam
No nickneoe ot time cun remove,
For when youth and beauty tre pant,
And age btings the winter of love,
A friendship ssinmsibly grows,
By revlews of auch mptum as them
The current os fandum still fieus,
Which decrepit old age cannot freae.

THE FLY.

Busx, curione, thirsty fiy,
Drink with me, and drink as 1³

Freely welcome to my cup,
Couldst thou sip, and sip it up ;
Make the most of life you may,
Life is shor't, and wears away.

Both alike, both thine and mine,

Hasten quick to their decline ;

Thine's a summer, mine's no more,
Though repented to threescore:
Threescore summers, when they're gone,
Will appear ag short as one.
