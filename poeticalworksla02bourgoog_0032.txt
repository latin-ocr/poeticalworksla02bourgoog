russeus or rus rursu cursores. 13

Ye rivers, beer his praise to every laud.
Praise him, ye sess, by whose supreme command
Your greatest rage is bounded by the saud.
No bounds or limits are assigned you here,
Nor can your utmost iorees go too iar.

Praise him, ye vvhales, and all the adver troia,
That, on the fifth day made, the watery main
Within its speeious bosom does contains
His praise, ye tish. by you be always sung,
Tho' mute, to bless your Maker, find e tongue.

Praise him, ye iowls, exalt his name, whate’er
Or skims the water, or divides the air,
Who clothes and ieeds you with paternal care.
Repeat his praise to every echoiug dale.
Ye morning lark, and evening uightiugale.

Praise him, ye beasts, that shady foreste sway,
Who seeds the lions roering ior their prey‚
Ye tamer kinds, that human force obey,
Present your prsise, more grateful to the skies
Thau thousands ol you slain in sacrifice.

Adoro, ye sons oi men, his aulul name,
Tho· iorm’d oi earth fill'd with etherial fleme,
Cast in the noblest, end the finest irame.
let lordly man his sovereigu’s praise declare,
And beauteous woman bless the truly sair.
