'rffll PARROT.

‘ramnum ΒΥ W. coma, ΕΒΩ,

ln painted plumes superbly dress'd,
A native of the gorgeous east,
By many a billow toss’d,

· Poll gains at length the Brilish shore,

Part of the captain’s previous stote,
A present io his toust.

Belinda’s maids are soon preserr’d,
To leuch him now and then a word,
⁸ As Poll can master it;
But 'tis her own important charge,
To qualify him more at largo,
And make him quite awit.

Sweel Polll his loting mistress ories,
Sweet Polli the mimie bird replies,
And ‚calls aloud ior sack.
she next instructs him in the lissi
‘Tis now a little one, like Miss,
And now a henrty smack,
