At down poor Stella danc’d and sung,
The om'rous youth uround her bow'd3
At night her fatal knell uus rung.
1 saw, and kiss’d het in her shuoud.

Such us ohe is, who died toduy.
Such 1, alus! moy be to-morrow;

Go. Damon, bid thy muse display
The justice os thy Chloe’s sorrow.

THE WREATH.

Swuou, lover, chone,
Ye lilios, hoste,
Thu in the vollieo breuthe:
To Phyllis haste,
Sweet, lovoly, obusto.
For Phyllis tuine the mouth.

Yo roseo, como,
With virgin bloom‚

¹The pride of gardens own'd;
Thut from your bed
Diffusive shed

Ambrosial odours round.
