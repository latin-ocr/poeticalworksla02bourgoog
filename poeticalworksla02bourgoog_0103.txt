sosio! ΤΟ cubos.

The love, that from besuty is drawn,
By kindness you ought to improves
Sost looks aud goy smiles are the down,
Fruition's the suushine of love:
And though the bright beems of your eyes
Should be elouded, thot now are so guy,
And darkness possess ull the skies,
We ue⁷er esu surget u uss dsy.

Old Dsrby, with-,Joan by his side,
You’ve osten regarded with wonder;
He’s dropsioah she is sore-eyed,
Yet they’re ever uneasy ssunder.
Together they totter about,
Or sitin the sun attho door;
Audet night, when old Dsrby's pot's out.
His Joan will not smoke a whiff more.

No besuty nor wit they possess,
Their several failings to smother;
Theo what arethe eherms, osu you guess.
Thst make'them so fond of esch other?
'Tis the pleasing remembrsnce of youth,
The eudesnuents which youth did besum
The thoughts of past plessure and truth,
The best of our blessiugs below.
