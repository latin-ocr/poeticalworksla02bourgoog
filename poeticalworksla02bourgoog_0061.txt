cornu's conruerur.

What tho’ 1 have skih to complainl
'Pho' the muses my temples have crown’d 1
What tho’‚ when they henr my soft strain,
The virgins rit weeping aroundl
Ah, Colin! thy hopes are in vain,
Thy pipo and thy laurel resigm
Thy false one inclines to euwain,
Whose music is sweeter than thiner

And you, my companions so dear,
Who sorrow to see me betray’d
Whatever 1 suffer, sorbeat,
Forbear to accuse the false maid.
Tho’ through the wide world Ι should range,
’Tis in vain from my fortune to fly:

'Twas her's to be false and to change ς

‘Tis mine to be constant and die.

Is, while my hard fatel sustain,
In her hreast any pity is found,

Let her come with the nymphs os the plain,
And see me laid low in the ground.

Tne last humble boon that lorove,
Isto shade me with oypress and yew;

And when she looks down in my grave,
Lot her own that her shepherd was true.
