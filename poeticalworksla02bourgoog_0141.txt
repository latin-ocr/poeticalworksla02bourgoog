Denth's delicium banquet-we
Pen’sh even from the womb,
Swifter than a shudow fiee,
Ι Nourish’d but to seed the tomb.

Seeds of merciless disemo
Lurk in ull that we enjoy;
Some that waste us by degrees,
Some that suddenly destroy.

Audis lise 0'erleap the bourn
Common to the sons of men,

What remains, but that we mourn,
Drem, and dote, and drivel then.

Pastas moon ean wax and wane.
Sorrow comem and, while we groan,
Pant with anguish‚ and complain,
Half our years are fied and gone.

1f a few (to few ’tis given),
Lingering on this earthly stage,
Creep and halt with steps unoven Ι
Το the period of an age,

Wherefore live they. but to see
Cunning‚ arrogance, and soree.

Sights lamented much by thee,
Holding their accustom'd course?
