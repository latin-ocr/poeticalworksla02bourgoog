Lucu· ᾹΝΙ) comis

Oh, heve you reen aiily pale,
When beoting ruins descendi

so droop’d the sion-consuming main
Her iiie now near its end.

By Luoy warn'd, of flotbering swoins
Take heed, ye easy fair:

Of vengeance due to broken νοτε,
Ye perJur'd sueino, benere.

Three times, ull in the deod of night,
A bell was heard to ring ; ’
And shrieking at her window thriee.

The raven flapp⁴d his wing.

Too well the love-iorn maiheu knew
The solemn boding sound‚

And thus. in dying werde, bespoke
The virgins weeping round ι

“ Ι hear a voice you cannot heah
Which says, Ι must not stay;

1 see u hand you cannot ree,
Which beckons me awuy.

By ai'aise beart, and broken vous,
in eariy youth Ι die:

Am Ι to blame, because his bride
Is thrice osrich as 1?
