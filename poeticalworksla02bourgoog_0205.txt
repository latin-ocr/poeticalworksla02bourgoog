The whltest hands thot secret honrd
0st vlsitz end the sair

Proserve it in their bosom stored
As with o misor's core.

Thence implemento of every sizo.
And form’d lor various use,

(They need hul to consult their eyes)
They reodily produce.

The largest ond the longest kind
Possess the fo'remost page,

A sort most needed by the blind,
Or nearly such from nge.

The full charged leaf, which next essuos,
Prosents in brighl arrny

The smallor sort, which malrons use.
Not quite so blind as they.

The third, the forth, the fifth supply
What their occasions osk, ¹

Who with e more discerning eye
Perforrn o nicer tcslr.

But still with regular decresse
From she to size they fall,

ln every lens grow less and less ;
The last are least of all.
