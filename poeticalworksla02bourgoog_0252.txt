AN ENIGMA.

extusum tt W· cowl’tta, HQ.

A nmmum small, as small cen be,

ln bulk and use, surpasses me,
Nor is my purchase dean

For little and almost for nought

As many os my kind are bought
As days ere in the year.

Yet though but little use we boest,

And ere procured at little eost,
The labour is not light3

Nor lew artificem it asks,

All skilsul in their several tesks,
To fashion us eright.

One fuses metal 0’er the flre,
Δ second drawa it into wire,
The shears another plies;
Who clips in lengths the brazen thread
For him, who, chaflng every shred,
Gives all an equel size.
