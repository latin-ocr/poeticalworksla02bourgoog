Homei native homei Ο might he hut repair! ,
He must-he will, though death attende him there.
He guen-and doom’d to perish on the sends
of the full theatre, unpitied stmids:
When loi the selisame lion from his cage
Flies to ¹devour him, famish’d into rege.
He flies z-but viewing in his purposed prey
The man, his beelei-pauses on his way,
And, sosten'd by remembrance into sweet
And kind composurer crouches at his feet.
Mute with astonishment, the essemhiy gaze ι
But why, ye Romans? Whence your mute amaze'?
Ali this is natural; Nature hade him rend
‘An enemy ;-she bids him spere a friend.
