HYMN THE FIRST.

1.
When all thy mermes, Ο my God.
My rising soul surveyS‚
Transported with the view l'm lost
In wonderelove, ond praise.
11.
Ohow shall words with equol warmlh,
The gratitudo deelare,
Thot glows within my ravish'd breasll
Bul thou const read it there,
111.

'l'hy providenoe my life susteih'd,
And all my ments remeet,

When in the silent womb lley‚
And hung upon the breast.

ιι.

Το all my weak complaints and ories
Thy mercy lent on ear,

Ere yet my feeble thoughts had learnt
'l'o form themselves in prey'r.

V.

Unnumber'd comforto to my soul
'l'hy tendet core bestow'd,

Before my infant hoarl conoeiv'd
From whom those comforts llow’d.
