6 THE SONG ot ’ῙἯΕ tunuli cflltnuhu.

And gives thee light, an'd is like thee but one.
Praise him, 0 moon, in borrow’d luetre bright‚

ln thisbe fitted, thou changing queen of night.

Ye twinkling stirs oi light, your praises show,

'Tis he that does your names and numbers know,
Alike inscrutable to all below.
Eooh star that does to menits beems dispense;

Praise him, as if inspired by some intelligenoe.

Praise him, ye gentle ond refieshing showers,
Praise him, ye dews; whose pearly'moisture pours
Odours and beauties on the vernol flowers.

Who more shouldohoose t’exalt his neme thau you?

He iether is of rain, begetier ot* the dew.

Ye winde, that, where you please, your sound may send, ’
ln hymns of joy your pious breathings spend

Oh i .praise him without bound, and without end.
