THE nalem.

Ost was seen, in ages past.

All that we with wonder view ς
Osten shall be to the last;

Barth produces nothin'g new.

Thee we gratulate, content,

Should propitious Heaven design
Life sor us as calmly spent,

Though but hals the length of thine.

THE CRICKET.

Imm inmuta, full of mirth‚
Chirping on my kitchen hamb,
Wheresoe'er be thine abode,
Always harbinger of good,

Psy me for thy warm retreat
With a song more soft and sweet;
ln return thou shalt receive

Such Q strain as 1 can give.
