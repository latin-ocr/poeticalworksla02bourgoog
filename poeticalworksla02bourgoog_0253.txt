A fifth prepsres, exact and round,
The knob, with which it must be crown’d;

His follower makes it fast:
And with his mallet and his file

'l’o shape the point, empldys awhile
The seventh and the last.

Now therefore! OEdipusl declara

What creature, wonderful, and rare,
A process, that obtains

Its purpose with so much ado, ,

At last produces l-tell me true,
And take mesor your peinsl

LABOR iNEPTlARUM.

Ur genera et species dignoscat papilionum,
Sitque quibus maculis quisque, quibusque notior
Quotquot agris volitant, studiose hinc colligit illinc,
Musaei ut servet Fulvius inter opes,
Thesaurum egregium Ι si quis foret usus habendi:
At cuinam haec servit cure laborque bono!
Papilio, centurn quamvis servetur in annos,
Nil nisi reliquiae papilionis erit.
