FAMILIARITY DANGEROUS.

Asin her ancient mistress’ lap
The youthful tabby lay,
They gave each other many a tap,

Alike disposed to play.

But strise ensues. Puss waxes warm.
And with protruded claws

Ploughs all the length of Lydia’s arm,
Mete wantonness the cause.

At once, resentful of the deed,
She shakes her to the ground

With many a threat, that she shall bleed
With still a deeper wound.

But, Lydii, bid thy sury rest;
lt was a venial stroke:
For she that will with kittens jest,

Should bear a kitten's joke.
