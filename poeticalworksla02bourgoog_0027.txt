8 THE SONG Οἳ THE Tum cultnnzn.

Who with majestic pomp, and terror join'd,
Rides charioting on clouds, and walks on wings os

wind.

Ye flames, exalt the universal choir;

On ned, bright as yourselves‚ to God aspire;

Gon, a consuming, and a harmless fite<
Whose falling sues Elijah’s soes could tame,

Who shone in Moses' bush a lambent flame.

Ye winter's chillness, and ye summer‘s sun,

'rhat round the year in stated periods run,
Praise him in your eternal antiphon,
Who‚ when the fatal flood os old was past,

Promis'd the seasons with the' world should last.

Ye honey-dews of May, like vapours rise.
Exhaled in praises to your native skies;

And hoary frost, which 0’er the meadow lies
