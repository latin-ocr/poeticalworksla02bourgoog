Butoh! may the goodness of God, is there be still
rnerey len for me, while it is yet called to-day, before
the night eometh on, so assist me with his grace in
working out my salvation, that neither the desire ,
oi life, nor the dread of death, may withdraw my
thoughts from him t but that, in this my day, Ι may
consider the things which make sor my peace, before
they are hid from my eyes. In humhle confidence
thereos, andin full assuranoe ot* his most gracious
merey to all returning sinners, Ι will endeavour to
fortify and prepare myself against the terrore oi
death.
