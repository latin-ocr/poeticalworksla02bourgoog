THE TEARS OF A PAINTER.

mmmm nv w. coma, aso.

Armua, hearing that his boy

Had just expired-his only joy 1
Although the sight with anguish tore him,
Bade place his deur remains b'efore him.
He seized his brush‚-his colours spread ι
And-‘⁴ oh1 my child, accept,”-he said,
“ (wis all that 1 can now bestow‚)

“This tribute of a father's woe!”

Then, faithful to the twosold part.

Both of his feelings and his art,

He closed his eyes with tendet care.

And form’d at once asellow-pair.

' His brow with amber looks beset,

And lips, he dmm-anot livid yet;

· And shaded that which he had done

Το a just image of his son.

Thus faris well. But view again
The cause of thy paternal pain!
Thy melancholy task fulffl 1
1t needs the last, last touches still.
Again his pencil’s powers he tries,
For on his lips asmile he spiam ,
And still his cheek unsaded shows
