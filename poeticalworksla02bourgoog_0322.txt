Hro infre jacet,
E silentio et tenebris
ln lucis et glorie tranrlerendn aeternitatem,
Egregii nominis mulier

Terris idcirco data et adempta,
Ut intelligerent homines
Quo virtus amore
Amplectenda sit incolumis,
Qua invidia
Quaerenda sit sublata.

IN BARBADOS.

Saered to the memory
of Annr, the beloved wife
ol Mn. Dunnnr Woonnnrnon.

lr the remembrence of whate'er was dear
Deserves the pious tribute ol a tear,

Bestow it on the dust that sleepeth neor:
That precious dust, which living did comprise
The fair, the good, the graceful, and the wise.
Bestow a tear ς nor think thy sorrow lost,
Another, and another, should it eost ι

The real north of virtue ne'er is known,

Till ravish'd from before our eyes, ond gone.

She died
October 5, nnccxxxrx.
Aged xxxvi.
