Tnsss isa bird, who by his eost,
And hythe hosrseness of his note,
Might be supposed a cr0w;
A great frequenter of the church,
Whers bishop-like he finds a perch,
And dormitory too. '
11.
Above the steeple shines a plats,
That turns and turns, to indicate
From what point blows the westher ;
Look up-your brains begin to swim,
'Tis in the clouds-that plesses him,
He chooses it the rather.
111.

Fond of the speculative height,
Thither he wings his airy ssight,
And thence securely sees
The bustle and the raree-sh0W,
That occupy mankind below,
Secure and at his ease.
