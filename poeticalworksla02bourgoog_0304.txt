EPILOGUE ΤΟ lemannus,

nonu ΒΥ IGNOBAUUS ANB DULHAN.

lemannus.

O nunrronns spectatoresque benigni,
0 all ye hearers and ye standers by3
Crede mihi dolet hoc munus mihi demandari ς
The epilogue puts me in a great quandary:
Effudique sales, mee lex consumitur et touter
My witin et an end, mylanis out.
Nescio quid dico, aut dieo quod non ego nosco 3
1 know not what to say, or say not what I know.
Why truly-may it please you-I demum
Memoria sine brief is never sure.

We, as we humbly do conceive, may move
These honourable benehes, ns above,
That we may now be cliente unto γους
·'Tis not ‘in forma pauperis’ we sue:
Andes we in your jndgment stand, that we
May likewise in your honours’ favour be.
This being granted, may be, gentlemen,
Weh humbly move this court to sit again,
After dne notice horr, end where, and when.
And so ye stand edjourned.

numen.
Gon seve the queen 1
