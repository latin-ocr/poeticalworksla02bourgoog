SPARROWS SELF-DOMESTICATED

IN retum comm, cumben.

retirement ΒΥ within( GOWPEB, ESQ·

Nore ever shared the social feast,
Or as an inmate ora guest,

Beneath the celebrated dome,

Where once Sir Isaac had his home,
Who saw not (and with some delight
Perhaps he view’d the novel sight)
How numerous, at the tables there,
The sparrows beg their daily fare.
For there, in every nook and cell,
Where such e family may dwell,
Sure ee the vernal season comes
Their nests they weeve in hope of cr'umbS,
Which kindly given, may serve with iood
Convenient their unfeather’d brood;
And ostes with its summons clear
The warning bell salutes their ear,
Sagacious listeners to the sound,
'l'hey fiock from all the fields around,
To reach the hospitable hali,

None more attentive to the eall.
Arrived, the pensionary barid,
Hopping and ehirping, close et hand,
