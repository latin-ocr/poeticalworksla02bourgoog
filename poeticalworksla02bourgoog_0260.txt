THE SNAIL.

TRANSLATED ΒΥ ἮΗΛΑΜ GOWPER, ESQ·

To grass, or leaf, or fruit, ot wall,

The Snail stieks close, nor fears to sall,

As if he grew there, house and all ,
Together.

Within that house secure he hides,
When danger imminent hetides
Of storm, or other harm besides

of weather.

Give but his horns the slightest touch,

His sels-collecting power is such,
He shrinks into his house with much
Displeasure.

Where’er he dwells, he dwells alone,
Eieept himself has chattels none,
Well satisfied to be his own
Whole treasure.
