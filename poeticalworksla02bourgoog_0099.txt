Luc! ΛΝΒ count.

“ Ah, Colin Ι give not her thy vows,
Vows due to me houm
Nor thou, fond maid, receive his kias,
Nor think him all thy ow'n.
To-morrow in the church to wed,
Impatient both preptm ,
But know, fond maid ; and know, false man,
Thnt Lucy will· be there.

‘⁶ There bear my porse, γε contradas. bear,
The bridegroom bhthe to meet3
He in 'his wedding trim :so gay, '
Ι in my windinghhqtt.”
She spolm, she died ;-her corse was borne,
The bridegroom blithetomeet; .
He in hs wedding him so gay, ‘
She in her winding-sheet.

Thon what were pmjur’d Colin’s thoughts?
How were those nuptiate kept? ,

The bridemen flock'd round Lucy dead,
And ull the village wept.

Compoesion, shame, remorsa,¹ despair.
At once his bosom swell;

The damps of death bedew'd his brows, ⁴ .
He shook, he groan’d, he fell. .· ³
