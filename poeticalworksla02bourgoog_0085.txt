To outline my senses‹l may it not be my iate,

To be blind, to be dees, to know nothing at all;

But rather let death come before ’tis so late,

And while there's some sap‘ in it, may my trees tall.
May lgovern‚ bc.

l hope 1 shall hove no occasion to send

For priests or physieinns, till I’m so near my end,

Thst Ihave eat all mybreed, and dranis my lost glass;s

Let them come then, ond set their seals to my pass!²
May l govern, dcc.

With s contage undonnted moy Ι face my lost day,
And when 1 am dead may· the better sort say,
In the morning when sober, in the evening when
mellow‚
He’s gone, and not lest behind him his fellow.
May 1 govern, &o

' Withont any noise,¹ when 1¹vepass’d o'er the stage,
'And deoently acted what part fortunek gave,

⁴ May 1 not lose my sight, my hearing, and my me-
mory‚ ond be a burden to my friends and myself: “Tellu-
ris inutilepondus,¹’ a dead unuseful burden to the ground.
ο Some corporeal end intellecturi vigour.

Expectanda dies homini est, dicique beatus
Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet. Ovro.
if you tell nn ltnlien, such on one is a rich or happy
man, he'll reply‚ “ Dammi Ιο morto‚'¹ as much ns to say,
Let me see him dead, and then it will be evident whether
he is or not; before that, no true judgment is to be mado.
