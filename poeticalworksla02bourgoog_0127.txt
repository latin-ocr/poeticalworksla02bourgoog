A yeor consumes,
Another eomes,
And then s new takes ploce :
Another new
Shull then ensue, ·
Another nem-to poss.

But, ull the while,

ller besuties smlle. “
And templ thelover's oure:

A year consumes,

Another comes;
And Phyllis stillis fair.

To ull one dete
Assigns not lete,
As plain, too plain, appears3
Your glories live,
Drys four or live,¹
But hers as many years.

Yet, gentlest rece,
Your fleeting grace

To blooming Phyllis lend:
And, ss you sade,
Remind the maid, ·

Thst years, like dsys, must entl.
