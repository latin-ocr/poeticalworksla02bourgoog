10 THE SONG ΟΞ THE eum culinum.

Like ashes scattet’d by his bounteous hand,
Restoring vigonr to the wearied land.

Praise him, ye irosts, that bind the earth in chains,
Praise him, ye cold, thei human force restrains,
Dead'ning the sense, end thriiiing in the veins.
His pmise for ever he by you extoiid, ,
Inflamed with andoure by tn· extreme os eold.

Praise him, you frose, long ns the irozen ses

ln midst os storms enjoys e calm by thee;

And spotless snow, the type of purity,
ln all your figur'd shapes his glory show,
Forgetnotheavenahove, when fell'n on earth below.

Be this your business, ye leborious days,

And silent nighis silver'd with glimmering [οἵω

Exempt from every work, but that of preise.
Whose pierc'mg eye does equel power display

· ’ In derkest midnight, and in brightest day.

Praise him, Ο light, in heavenly benms array'd ;

Parentes day, and first of beings, shede;

Praise him, who reign'd bsiore the world was made,
Who dwells in brightness, and who rides in night,
Mnjesiic darkness, end elluring light.
