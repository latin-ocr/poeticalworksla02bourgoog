0! what a fund os geniuS, pent
In narrow space is here!

This volume's method and intent

· How lumInous and clear!

It leaves no render at a loss
Or posed‚ whoever reads:

No commentator's tedious glosa
Nor even index needS.

Search Bodley's many thousands o’er!

No book is treasured there,
Nor yet in Granta’s numerous stote,
That may with his compare.

No l-rival none in either host
of this was ever seen,

Or, that contents cduld justly boat,
So brilliant and so keen.
