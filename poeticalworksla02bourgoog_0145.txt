Thus thy proise shall be expreeo'd
inoffeneive‚ weloorne guenti

While the ret is on the scoot,

And the mouee with curione enout,
With what vermin else inieet
Ev’ry dish, and spoil the best;
Frisking thus before the fise,

Thou host all thine heert’e desire.

Though in voice end ehepe they be
Form’d as ii ahin to thee,

Thou surpaseest, hoppier sar,
Happiest grasshoppere thot are3
Theirs is but o summer's song,
Thine endures the winter long,
Unirnpeir'd, and ehrill, and clear,
Melody throughout the year.

N either night nor down oi day,

Pois e period to thy play:

Sing, then-and expend thy spen

Far beyond the dote oi man.
Wretched mon, whose years are spent
ln repining discontent,

Livee not, aged though he he,

Half a spon, compared with thee. ⁴
