ΤΟ THE KING.

Gerre neme*, which in our rolls recorded stands,
hedde, honours, ond protecte the learned bande,
Accept this offering, to thy bounty due,

And Roman wealth in English sterling vieo.
Read here, how Britain, once despised, oon mise
As ample sums, es Rome in Oaeear’s doye3

Pour forth as numerous legione on the plain.

And with more dreodsul novies owe the moin.

· The King'e neme stands first in the buttery-book of f
Christ-Choreb College· ’
