DENNER'S OLD WOMAN.

TRANBLATED nl wluin! COWPBR, ΕΜ.

ln this minoio lorm oi o muron in years.

How plainly the poncii ol Denner uppem!

The motion herself, in whose old nge we see

Not a trooeofdoclinef-what ι wonder is ohe 1

No dimoess of eye, ond no oheek honging low,

Nor wrinkle, or deep-iorrow‘d lrown on the brow l

Her forehoad indeed is her oiroled aronnd

With looks like the ribbon with whloh they are bound;

While glossy and mouth, ond os soil nn the olio

Of a delicate penei, is the down ol her chios

But nothing unplensonn or sod, 'or nevere,

Or that indicates life in its winter-is here;

Yet all is express'd with fidelity due,

Nor opimplo or lreokle oonoeol'd from lhe view.
Many fond of now signis. or who cherisi ι mle

For labours-ol' ort, to the speotoole haste.

The youths ull agree, that, would old nge inopine

The passion oi love, hers would kindle the firm

And the mairona with pleniore confess thot they see

Ridiculous· nothing or hideous in thee. y

The nymphe for themselves scarcely hope adeoline,

Ο wonderful womanl os placid os thino.
