THE §Now-Mo?

And shouldst thou, compell'd by a frost,
Come again to my window or door,
Doubt not an affectionate host,
Only pay as thou paidst me before.

This music must needs be consess’d
To flow from afountain above;
Else how should it work in the breast
Unchangeable friendship and love?
And who on the globe can be sound,
Save your generation and ours,
That can be delighted by sound,
Or boasts any musical pow’rs?

THE SNownROP. ’

qu head reclin'd‚ the snowdrop seel
The first of Flora's progeny,

ln virgin modesty appear.

'1¹0 hail and welcome in the year 1

Fearless of winter, it defles

The rigour of inclement skies.
And early hastens forth to nring ὓ
The tidings os approaehing spring.
