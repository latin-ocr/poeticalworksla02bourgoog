winilnu ΛΝΒ Mennim.

Her bloom was like the springing fiower,
That sips the silver dew3

The rose vves budded in her eheek,
And opening to the view.

But love had, like the canivet-worm,
Consum'd her early prime:

The rose grew pale, and left her eheek;
She died before her time.

Anake, she nied, thy true love caiis,
Come from her midnight grave;
Now iet thy pity hear the maid,
Thy love tefus’d to save.

This is the dark end sensui honr,
When injur’d ghosts eomplein;

Now dreary graves give up their dead,
Το haunt the suithless swein.

Bethink thee, Williem, of thy fault,
Thy pledge, end broken oeth;
And give me back my maiden vow,

And give me back my iroth.

How could you say my fece was fair,
And yet that fece forsake?

How could you win my virgin heart,
Yet leave that heert to break?
