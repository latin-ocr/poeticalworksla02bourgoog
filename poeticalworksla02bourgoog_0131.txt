She lihes not wit in lewdness shown,
Jests ill-manner'd sor a clowm

But hem, with ignorance or tage,
Double meanings of the stage.

Her spotless mind, the lustful tale
Nauseates in the nicest veil.

She ne’er is found in crowds unclean‚
Entred mysteries obscene ;

Nor seeks in math, and antio dress,
Unconflned lasciviousness:

Nor pale, and angry, gaming high,
Rattles the unhtcky die.

Till sunrise restless vigils keeps.
Light consuming in her sleeps;

Inverting nature, turns with play
Day to night, and night to day.

This round of follies let her choose, ·
Flitting life who likes to lose, ·

And lets her quietly·ending days
Pasa, and perish as they pass.

The time that vulgar maids despise. ’
Careless, thoughtless‚ how it hies,

Melissa wise, esteems‚ and knows
Well to use it, ere it goes.

Is e'er Melissa wed my friend.
With her ent'ring shoh attend

Virtues and graces by her side.
Bridemaids fit sor such a bride=

Neat beauty without art display'd.
Rosy health with native red ;
