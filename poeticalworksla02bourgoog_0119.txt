The flow¹rs she wore along the day;
And av’ry nymph and ehepherd said,

Thai in her hair 'they look'd more gay
Then glowing in their native bed.

Undrest at evening‚ when she found
Their colours lost. their odours past,

She chang'd her look, and on the ground ¹
Her gerland and her eye she cast.

As any muae’e tongue could speak;
When from its lid apearly tear
Ran triekling down her heauteous cheek.

Dissembling what 1 knew too weil,
“ My love, my liie‚'’ said 1, “ explain,
This change oi humour; pr'ythee tell,
Thet falling tear, what does it mean?

She sigh’d; she smiled; end to the flowers
Pointing, the lovely moralist said,

See, friend, in some few fleeting houna,
See yonder, what a change is medei

Ah mei the-blooming pride of May
And that oi beauty ere hui one;
