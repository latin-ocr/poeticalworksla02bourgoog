Let lsitht‘ul Abrom’s rece their offrings bring,

By tunelul stid taught his praise to sing,

Their guide, their legislator, und their iring:

ι Who spread o’er Egypt’s lsnd substantisl night,
Who with a longer sun did Joshus's luith requite.

Ye priests ol God, let prsise like incense rise,
Tho’ Corsh’s sons your order may despise,
And wish the priest himself a sacrifice.
Praise him lor others too, und thus commend
Your greatest en’mies to your only friend.

Praise him, his servants who have learnt to see, -

. There’s nought so sweet us this captivity,

From whence 'tis greatest bondsge to be free.
Praise him, whose power can grant whate're you move,
Whose esrs will henr your prayers, for he is love.

ι Ye rightecus souls, untainted with your clay,
Spring thro’ the vost expense and wing your way,
To resch the confines ol eternul dsy.

Celestisl snthems sing with seraphs join’d,

And souls unbodied bless the almighty mind.

Ye humble men, whom seli-admiring pride,
With ell its baits, could never drew asido,
Praise him, whose love does o’er the meelr preside:

· Who throws the purple tyronis from their seat,

And makes the poor ol spirit rich sud great.
