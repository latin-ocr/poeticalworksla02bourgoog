HYMN THE mnsn.

v1.
When in the slipp'ry paths of youth
With heedless steps 1 ran,
Thine arm unseen convey'd me sese,
And led me up to man.
vn.
Through hidden dengers, toils, end deame,
lt gently cleared my wey,
And through the plensing snares of vice,

More to be fear'd than they. ‘
vrn.

When nvom with' siekness, oft hest thou
With health renew'd my face3

And when in sins and sorrows sunk,

Reviv'dmy soul with grece.
ιι.
Thy bounneous hand, with worldly blisn
Has made my cup run o'er;
And in a kind end faithful friend
Has doubled all my stote.

x.

Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My dnily thnnks employ;

Nor ie the least e eheerfnl heert,

Thnt netes those gnte with joy.
x1. .
Through ev'ry period os my lire, ‘
Thy goodness l'll pursne;
And nster death, in distant worlds¹
The glorious theme renen.
